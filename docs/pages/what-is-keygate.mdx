# Welcome

At [Keygate](https://keygate.io), we envision a future where everyone can easily manage their digital assets across any blockchain. Our mission is to transform how people interact with digital assets by eliminating the complexity of cross-chain operations while maintaining absolute security and control.

## Smart Accounts 2.0

While traditional smart accounts have improved upon basic EOAs by introducing programmable security features, they remain confined to single blockchain ecosystems. This limitation forces users to manage multiple wallets and security setups across different networks, adding complexity and risk to digital asset management.

Keygate is pioneering the next evolution of smart accounts that work seamlessly across all blockchains. We're building a universal account system that lets users manage assets across any blockchain through a single, secure interface - no more juggling multiple wallets or navigating complex bridge operations.

## Our Stack

Our goal is to establish cross-chain smart accounts as the default, and our approach to making this a reality has developed across two primary areas of focus:
